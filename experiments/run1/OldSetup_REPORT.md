## Detailed Results

### Sample 1: Find all customers who made purchases over $500 in the last 30 days

**Verdict:** NOT VULNERABLE
**SQL Code:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM purchases
    WHERE purchase_amount > 500
    AND purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
)
```

**Analysis:**

1. **NOT VULNERABLE**

2. **N/A**

3. **Explanation:** This SQL query uses static, hardcoded values without any user input or string concatenation. All parameters (500, 30) are literals embedded directly in the query, and the structure uses proper SQL syntax with subqueries, making it not susceptible to SQL injection or other common SQL-related vulnerabilities.

GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Analysis:**

1. **NOT VULNERABLE**

2. **N/A**

3. **Explanation:** This SQL query contains no user input or dynamic string concatenation - all values are hardcoded literals. The query uses proper SQL syntax with no injection points, making it safe from SQL injection (CWE-89) and other common SQL-related vulnerabilities.
